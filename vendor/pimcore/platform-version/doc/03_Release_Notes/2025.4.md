# Release 2025.4
Here you will find all the important new features and release notes of the Platform Version 2025.4 release.
Please also make sure to run all migrations after update.

## LTS Version
Pimcore 2025.4 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Starting with 2025.4 we extended the LTS support duration to 
3 years from the date of release.

## Most Important New Features

### Full Symfony 7 Support
Platform Version 2025.4 supports both Symfony 6.4 and Symfony 7, providing a smooth migration path for upgrading your 
application.
Support for all Symfony 6.x components will be removed in Platform Version 2026.1.

#### Symfony Freeze Bundle
To control Symfony version constraints in Platform Version 2025.4, use the Symfony Freeze metapackage:

```bash
composer require pimcore/symfony-freeze:^6  # Stay on Symfony 6
composer require pimcore/symfony-freeze:^7  # Switch to Symfony 7
```

For more details see [pimcore/symfony-freeze](https://github.com/pimcore/symfony-freeze).

**Note:** This package is only for Platform Version 2025.4. Platform Version 2026.1 will require Symfony 7+ and drop 
Symfony 6 support entirely.


### Experimental MCP Server Support
Experimental support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables AI agents and LLMs to access Pimcore data. 
The implementation includes configuration, authentication, and integration with Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
Details see the [MCP Server Documentation](https://docs.pimcore.com/platform/Datahub_Simple_Rest/MCP_Server).

## Additional Improvements

- **Core Framework**
  - Added command to detect changes of class definitions to ease deployment processes
  - Refactored Version CleanUp Task and optimized slow queries to improve performance
  - Added method to check if a `pimcoreblock` of Pimcore Documents is empty from outside the block
  - Added functionality to register additional and custom functions for Symfony expression in calculated value data types.

- **Portal Engine**
  - Improved visualisation of advanced metadata columns in data object detail pages.
  - Improved handling of quantity value data types in grids

- **Data Importer**
  - Added configurable logging controls to the Data Importer to prevent generating millions of unnecessary info logs and
    reduce server inode consumption from file objects during large imports.

## Studio Support
Pimcore Studio is not part of Platform Version 2025.4 and thus also not part of the LTS promise. However, Pimcore 
Studio is compatible with Platform Version 2025.4 and can be used alongside it.

Platform version 2025.4 bundles will receive ongoing functionality updates for Pimcore Studio compatibility until the 
release of 2026.1.

**Therefore, Platform Version 2025.4 will be the Platform Version with parallel support of 
Admin Classic UI and Pimcore Studio.**

With release of Platform Version 2026.1, Platform Version 2025.4:
- will be fully compatible with Pimcore Studio
- will receive bugfix updates concerning Pimcore Studio compatibility for 3 more months
- will receive LTS updates for platform version functionality (not for Studio)
- won't receive any further functionality updates


## Deprecation of Admin UI Classic
Platform Version 2025.4 is the last version supporting the Admin UI Classic Bundle. Platform Version 2026.1 will 
remove the Admin UI Classic Bundle entirely.


## Additional Deprecations

The functionality of the following bundles will be provided by Pimcore Studio, and therefore they will be deprecated:
- Advanced Object Search
- Simple Backend Search Bundle
- Perspective Editor

The following bundles will be discontinued in Platform Version 2026.1, and therefore deprecated in this Platform Version:
- File Explorer Bundle
- Glossary Bundle
- Google Marketing Bundle
- Newsletter Bundle
